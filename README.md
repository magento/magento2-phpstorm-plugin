## Setting up development environment

1. Check out this repository

1. Make sure that you on the latest develop branch (e.g `4.3.0-develop`)
1. Right-click on the `build.gradle` file, choose "Import Gradle project" (if this is not exist look for "Build module '<root folder name>'") (you need to have Gradle plugin installed)
1. Check if the right SDK version is used for the project.
   - Current Java version for the project is **java 11**, so you should additionally download **SDK 11** and choose it in the module settings: `Right click by the project root > Open Module Settings > Project Settings > Project > Project SDK`
   - Check if right SDK version is used for the Gradle plugin: `Intellij IDEA > Preferences... > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle > Gradle JVM` and choose your JDK.
1. When the Gradle sections appeared in the right bar, navigate there and right-click `magento-2-php-storm-plugin > Tasks -> Intellij -> runIde`
1. Click `Run "magento-2-php-storm-plugin"` to run the plugin. You should see a new instance of IntelliJ launched with the plugin installed. Make sure the plugin is enabled in IntelliJ settings and indexing is finished. Plugin features should be accessible at this point.

## How to create SandBox for development
1. Create sandbox folder
2. Copy to sandbox folder `composer.json` and `composer.lock`
3. In sandbox folder create `app/code` and `vendor/magento`
4. Copy any of the magento modules (as for example: `framework`, `module-catalog`, `module-checkout`, `module-customer`, `module-sales`) into the `vendor/magento` folder. It is better to add as few modules as possible to reduce reindexing time during application running
5. (Nice to have) Open IDE and go to `Preferences > Editor > File and Code Templates > Includes tab` and add default headers for `PHP File Header` and `XML File Header`
   
**PHP File Header:**
```php
/**
 * Copyright © Magento, Inc. All rights reserved.
 * See COPYING.txt for license details.
 */
declare(strict_types=1);
```

**XML File Header:**
```xml
<!--
/**
 * Copyright © Magento, Inc. All rights reserved.
 * See COPYING.txt for license details.
 */
-->
```
